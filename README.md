## Findings Summary
This project explores the intersection of Bitcoin mining and quantum computing. The analysis shows that while current quantum computers are not yet capable of outperforming classical Bitcoin miners, future developments in quantum hardware could disrupt the industry. The research provides insights into how Bitcoinâ€™s cryptographic security could be affected and suggests mitigation strategies.
